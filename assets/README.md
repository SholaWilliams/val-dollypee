Place your files here:

- `music/` — add multiple songs (e.g., `song1.mp3`, `song2.mp3`). A random one plays on each visit. You can also keep a single `music.mp3` at the root for compatibility.
- `photos/` — add her photos as `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, etc. You can use any names; just update the image paths in `photobooth.html`.

Tips:
- Keep images reasonable size (under ~1–2 MB each) for smooth loading.
- Use JPEG for photos; PNG/WebP work too.
- Autoplay may be blocked by the browser; click the floating widget to start playback.
